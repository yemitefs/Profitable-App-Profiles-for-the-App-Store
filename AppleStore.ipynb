This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, one could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app as i could deduce above that dictionary has lots of user ratings, hence it is essential.\n",
