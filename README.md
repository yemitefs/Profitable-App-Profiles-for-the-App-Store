# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store
My aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store. Doing this as a data analysts to help any company that builds Android & IOS mobile apps out there, and my objective is to enable developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kinds of app they build. The apps that are likely to attract customers.

As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play.
It would take lots of money and efforts to gather over 4 million apps data, so we'll try to analyze a sample of data instead.  Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our purpose:

A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/version/6) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play

A [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home) containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store
